This code is the entry point of a C# console application that reads data from Excel files and inserts the data into a SQL Server database.

Here's a summary of what the code does:

1. Retrieves the Excel files directory path from the App.config file using the 'ConfigurationManager.AppSettings' property
2. Retrieves a list of all Excel files in the specified directory using the 'Directory.GetFiles' method.
3. Retrieves the SQL Server connection string from the 'App.config' file using the 'ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings' property.
4. Retrieves the log folder path from the App.config file using the 'ConfigurationManager.AppSettings' property.
5. Configures the dependencies for the application using the 'ConfigureServices' method.
6. Loops through each Excel file in the list:

a. Retrieves the file info for the Excel file using the FileInfo class.
b. Checks if the file has already been processed by querying the 'ProcessedFiles' table in the SQL Server database using the 'IsFileProcessed' method of the 'IDataReaderService' interface.
c. If the file has not been processed, reads the data from the Excel file into a 'DataTable' using the 'ReadExcelToDataTable' method of the 'IDataReaderService' interface.
d. Defines the column mappings between the Excel file's columns and the SQL Server table's columns using a 'Dictionary<string, string>' object.
e. Defines any additional columns that are not present in the Excel file but are required in the SQL Server table using a 'Dictionary<string, Func<object>>' object. column such as 'FileDate'.
f. Inserts the data from the 'DataTable' into the SQL Server table using the 'SaveToDatabase' method of the 'IDataReaderService' interface.
g.  Logs the processed file's file name and last modified date/time to the 'ProcessedFiles' table in the SQL Server database using the 'LogProcessedFile' method of the 'IDataReaderService' interface.

NOTE - Create a table in the database to log processed files

SQL Script to Create Log Table:

CREATE TABLE ProcessedFiles (
    FileName NVARCHAR(255) PRIMARY KEY,
    LastModified DATETIME
);



The code uses dependency injection (DI) to resolve the dependencies of the application. 
The ConfigureServices method configures the DI container by registering the interfaces and implementations with the container. 
The serviceProvider object is then used to resolve the IDataReaderService interface. This allows for greater flexibility and maintainability of the code.
